# Cabinet-furniture-service

<p>It is my first course work, written in C++ language. It was simulated in MS ACCESS and MS EXCEL, than based on database model I started to realise it using C++</p>

<p>This project helped me to learn more about OOP programming paradigm.</p>

<h3>App has following functionallity:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Multilingual interface.</b> Currently, it is translated in english and ukrainian, but provided extension to make more languages</li>
    <li><b>Loading data from file including spaces.</b> App can parse data with spaces. It uses tab as separator.</li>
    <li><b>Printing tables, that fit to content.</b> App has "Alignment" class, that allows you to configure table printing. Also tables become wider if there is longer text line in table cell</li>
    <li><b>Queries.</b> This can help to get useful information about service status</li>
    <li><b>Convenient interface.</b> Most of command require only to choose appropriate digit and press enter to run it</li>
 </ol>
